# evolve2d

## Introduction

An evolutionary world in 2d.

The idea of this software is to develop some sort of _evolutionary system_ where we can estabilsh _amoebas_ in a particular _world_ that can wonder around.

Some _survival rules_ will be applied to the _world_ from time to time to see how _amoebas_ evolve over time.

The idea is that each _amoeba_ will have some features, neurons and connections and after some iterations a _survival rule_ will be applied and see if the _amoebas_ evolve automagically.
